Thoughts and Conclusions:
1. Since data file has time, value, and some data center type, first idea is to draw a standard line plot.
2. First graph is unreadable with the heavy negative skew values. Remove negative values and plot another graph.
3. Second graph is readable and clearly displays similar pattern between blue and red lines. Both red and blue lines have 2 massive drops in value at approximately the same time while green has periodic trend except for one instance of time.
