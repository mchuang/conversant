Thoughts and Conclusions:
1. Since data file has time, value, and some data center type, first idea is to draw a standard line plot to better understand the nature of the data.
2. I started by plotting line graphs for each of the data centers. First graph is unreadable with the heavy negative skew values. A quick google search suggeests rtb = real time bids so values might be money. Remove negative values and plot another graph. 
3. Second graph is readable and clearly displays similar pattern between two of the data center lines. In addition, both these data centers have 2 massive drops in value at approximately the same time while the 3rd data center has periodic trend except for one instance of time.
